# Image Password Strength

###### Day 46 of 100

Hey there! Welcome to the Image Password Strength project. This is a neat little experiment that helps you visualize the strength of your password using an image.

## What's It About?

You know when you're creating a password, and you want to make sure it's strong enough? This project takes that concept and makes it more fun and visual. As you type your password, you'll see an image in the background change its blur based on how strong your password is.

## How It Works

Here's the deal: the longer and more complex your password, the less blurry the background image becomes. It's like a game! You try to create a strong password, and the background rewards you by becoming clearer.

## Getting Started

1. First, you need to include the Bootstrap CSS file from a content delivery network (CDN). We've got a link for that in the HTML code above.

2. Copy the HTML snippet from this README and paste it into your HTML file where you want this password strength visualizer to appear.

3. Make sure you also link to your custom `main.css` file to style the page to your liking.

4. Finally, include Bootstrap's JavaScript for some interactive features.

## How to Use

1. When you open this webpage, you'll see a form with an email input and a password input.

2. Start typing your password into the password input field.

3. As you type, pay attention to the background image. It will become less blurry the stronger your password gets.

4. Have fun creating strong passwords!

## Customization

Feel free to customize the look and feel of the page by editing the `main.css` file. Make it match your website's style and personality.
