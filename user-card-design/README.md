# User Card Design

###### Day 53 of 100

This is a simple user card design created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to display user information in an attractive way and provides interactivity when you click on a card.

## Features

- Display user profile images.
- Show user names and roles.
- Interactive highlighting of cards when clicked.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the user cards.

3. Click on a card to highlight it. Clicking on another card will remove the highlight from the previous one.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript code (`script.js`) is responsible for adding interactivity to the user cards. It listens for click events on the cards and toggles the "active" class to highlight the clicked card while removing the highlight from others.
