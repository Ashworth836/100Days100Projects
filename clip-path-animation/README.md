# Clip-Path Animation

###### Day 76 of 100

## Overview

This is a simple web animation using the clip-path property to create dynamic shapes. Each shape moves in a visually interesting way, creating a captivating visual effect.

## How It Works

- Four div elements (`img1`, `img2`, `img3`, and `img4`) are positioned absolutely on the page.
- Each div has a background image from Unsplash and uses the clip-path property to define its shape.
- The shapes undergo a subtle animation, creating a continuous and mesmerizing effect.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Customization

Feel free to modify the clip-path shapes or experiment with different background images. Adjust the animation properties in the CSS file (`main.css`) to suit your preferences.

Enjoy the playful visual experience! ðŸ˜Š
