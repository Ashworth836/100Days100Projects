# Email Verification Code Input

###### Day 42 of 100

This is a simple web page script for entering a six-digit verification code sent to your email. It's handy for confirming your email address in various online services.

## How It Works

This script lets you enter a verification code digit by digit. Here's how it works:

1. We'll send you a six-digit code to your email. Please check your email for this code.

2. Open this web page and enter the code. You'll see six input boxes, one for each digit of the code.

3. You can only enter numbers (0-9) into these boxes. If you try to type anything else, it won't work.

4. Start by typing the first digit. When you do, the cursor automatically moves to the next box. It's smooth and easy!

5. If you make a mistake and want to go back, just press the "Backspace" key, and you'll go to the previous box.

6. Once you've entered all six digits, you're good to go. You've successfully confirmed your email!

## Example

You can try this code out by opening the HTML file (index.html) included in this repository in your web browser. It's a simple, interactive way to understand how it works.

## Note

Please remember that this is just a design demonstration. We didn't actually send you an email with a code because, well, we don't have your email address! ðŸ˜„

That's it! It's a user-friendly way to enter those pesky verification codes you often receive in your inbox.

Feel free to use this script in your own projects where you need to verify email addresses.
