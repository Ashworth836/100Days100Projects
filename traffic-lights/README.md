# Traffic Lights

###### Day 86 of 100

## Overview

This small web page simulates a classic traffic light system. It's a fun project that uses simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive traffic light display.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Observe the simulation of a traffic light.
3. The lights will change in sequence (red, yellow, green) in a loop.

## Features

- **Realistic Lights**: The circles mimic the appearance of actual traffic lights with distinct colors.
- **Smooth Transition**: The light transitions are smooth and resemble the gradual change of a real traffic light.
- **Interactive Simulation**: The lights automatically change in a loop, providing an interactive display.

## Customization

- You can customize the colors of the traffic lights by adjusting the background colors and box shadows in the CSS file (`main.css`).
- Experiment with the transition time in the JavaScript file (`script.js`) to change the speed of the light sequence.

Feel free to use this code to create your own traffic light simulation or incorporate it into your projects! ðŸš¦ðŸš—
