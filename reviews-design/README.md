###### Day 25 of 100

Welcome to the Reviews Design project! This simple project lets you display the distribution of ratings and their corresponding percentages in a visually engaging way.

## Description

The project showcases different ratings, from 1 to 5 stars, along with the percentage of reviews that fall into each category. It's a neat visual representation of how users perceive your product or service.

## Features

- Clear visualization of ratings distribution.
- Dynamic progress bars that adjust based on review percentages.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. You'll see a header and a brief description.
3. Look below to find the reviews and their associated progress bars.
4. The width of each progress bar reflects the percentage of reviews for that rating.
5. You can add more reviews and their percentages by modifying the HTML and CSS.
