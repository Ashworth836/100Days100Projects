# Moving Hamburger Animation

###### Day 66 of 100

Welcome to the world of animated hamburgers! üçî This simple webpage showcases a delightful hamburger menu that comes to life when you click on it.

## How to Interact

- **Left Menu:** Located on the left side.
- **Center Menu:** Right in the center.
- **Right Menu:** Hangs out on the right side.

Click on any of these menus, and watch the magic happen. The hamburger lines will change color, indicating your selection.

## Behind the Scenes

Here's a brief rundown of what's going on in the code:

### HTML Structure

- There are three menus on the page (left, center, and right).
- A special menu with the class "active" is identified as `to-move`.

### CSS Styling

- Clean and crisp styling defines the look of the hamburger menus.
- The `transition` property adds a smooth animation effect.

### JavaScript Magic

- The script handles the click events on each menu.
- When a menu is clicked, it becomes active, and the `to-move` menu inherits its class.

## Customization

Feel free to play around with the code, change colors, or add more menus. The stage is yours!

## Technologies Used
