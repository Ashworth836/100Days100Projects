# Waves

###### Day 96 of 100

Welcome to the Waves interactive experience! Click on a dot, and watch the magic unfold.

## How to Play

Just one rule: **Click a dot. Any dot.**

## Technical Stuff

- **Fonts:**
  - We're styling with [Mulish](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish) and [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) fonts because readability is cool.

- **Dot Grid:**
  - The dots are organized in a grid, and each one is clickable. Click a dot, and it will ripple out in a wave-like pattern.

- **Animations:**
  - We've added a smooth grow-and-shrink effect to make it visually interesting. The dots will grow briefly when clicked.

## Game On!

Feel free to experiment. Can you create a wave that spans the entire grid? The challenge is yours!

Happy clicking! ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒŠ
