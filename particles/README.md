Welcome to the Particles project! This is a fun and simple web animation that creates colorful moving particles on your screen.

## How It Looks

When you open this web page, you'll see a bunch of little circles moving around. They leave colorful trails as they go. It's like having your own mini light show right in your browser!

Inside this project, we use the p5.js library to create these cool particle animations. It's a creative way to add some life and movement to a webpage.

## Features

- Dynamic particles: The particles move around your screen, creating a dynamic and eye-catching display.
