## Overview

The Mobile Tab Navigation is a simple web page that simulates a mobile phone's interface. It features a lock screen with a time and date display, and when you click the phone screen, it unlocks to reveal a set of tabs for Home, Work, Blog, and About Us. You can switch between these tabs by clicking on them.

## How it Works

- **HTML Structure**: The HTML structure includes elements for the phone, lock screen, time and date display, and navigation tabs. Images are used for the different tabs, and Font Awesome icons are used for the navigation icons.

- **CSS Styling**: The CSS code styles the phone and its components, including the lock screen, time and date display, and navigation tabs. It also includes animations for the lock screen bounce effect.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the navigation tabs. When you click on a tab, it shows the corresponding content and highlights the active tab.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashworth836/mobile-tab-navigation.git
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the mobile tab navigation in action.

3. Click on the phone screen to unlock it, and then click on the navigation tabs to switch between different sections.

4. Customize the content and tabs to fit your project's needs.

## Customization

You can customize this mobile tab navigation to suit your requirements:

- **Images**: Replace the images in the `img` tags in the HTML with your own tab icons or images.

- **Styling**: Adjust the CSS styles in the `main.css` file to change the appearance of the phone, lock screen, and tabs.

- **Content**: Modify the content within the tabs to provide information relevant to your project.
