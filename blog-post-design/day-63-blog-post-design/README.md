# Blog Post Design

###### Day 63 of 100

Welcome to the Blog Posts showcase! üìù In this minimalist corner of the web, we're keeping things simple and stylish. Let's dive into the details.

## Features

- **Clean Layout:** The blog posts are displayed in a neat and clean layout, making it easy to read and engage with the content.
- **Dynamic Content:** Three posts are dynamically fetched and displayed from external APIs on each page load.
- **User-Friendly Design:** The user information, including a profile picture, adds a personal touch to each post.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) and [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue) fonts from Google Fonts.

## Behind the Scenes

The magic happens in the `script.js` file, where we fetch random blog post data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and user data from [RandomUser](https://randomuser.me/api/), combining them to create engaging content.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the styles in the `main.css` file to match your preferences. Adjusting colors, fonts, or layout‚Äîit's all in your hands.
