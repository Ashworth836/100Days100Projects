# Random Meal Generator

###### Day 1 of 100 

The Random Meal Generator is a simple web application that allows users to get a random meal suggestion by clicking a button. The application fetches meal data from the MealDB API and displays the details of the meal, including an image, category, area, tags, ingredients, and instructions. If available, it also shows a video recipe from YouTube.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the files from GitHub.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. When the page loads, you'll see a "Feeling Hungry?" message and a button labeled "Get Meal üçî".

4. Click the "Get Meal üçî" button to fetch a random meal from the MealDB API.

5. The details of the random meal will be displayed, including an image, category, area, tags, ingredients, and instructions. If a video recipe is available, it will also be shown below the instructions.

6. To get another random meal, simply click the "Get Meal üçî" button again.
