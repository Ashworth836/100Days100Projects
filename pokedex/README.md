###### Day 6 of 100

Welcome to PokeDex! This is a simple web page that showcases a collection of Pokémon with their images, numbers, and types.

## How to Use

Just open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the PokeDex. The page will display a list of Pokémon cards with their images, numbers, and types.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Displays Pokémon images, numbers, and types.
- Fetches Pokémon data from the PokeAPI and dynamically creates the Pokémon cards.
- Uses different colors for each Pokémon card based on its type.

## Colors and Types

The colors of the Pokémon cards represent their primary type. Each Pokémon belongs to one of the following types:

- Grass
- Electric
- Water
- Ground
- Rock
- Fairy
- Poison
- Bug
- Dragon
- Psychic

## How It Works

The PokeDex fetches Pokémon data from the PokeAPI and dynamically generates the cards based on the fetched data. The cards display the Pokémon's image, number, name, and primary type.
