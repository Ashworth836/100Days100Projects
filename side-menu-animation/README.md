# Side Menu Animation

###### Day 51 of 100

Hey there! This is the Side Menu Animation project. It's a cool way to add a hidden sidebar menu to your website that slides in and out with a smooth animation.

## What's It All About?

Ever wanted a sidebar menu that's there when you need it and neatly tucked away when you don't? This project does just that! It's perfect for giving your website a sleek and modern touch.

## How Does It Work?

It's as simple as clicking a button! You add this code to your webpage, and when users click the menu button, the sidebar elegantly slides into view. Click it again, and it gracefully disappears.

## Getting Started

To use this Side Menu Animation:

1. Copy the HTML code snippet from this README and paste it into your HTML file wherever you want the sidebar to appear.

2. Ensure you have a custom `main.css` file to style your content.

3. That's it! Your users can now enjoy a fancy sidebar menu.

## How to Use

1. Open your webpage.

2. Click the menu button, and watch the sidebar slide in from the left.

3. Click it again, and poof! It slides away. Magic!

## Customization

Feel free to make it match your website's style! Edit the `main.css` file to change colors, fonts, and more. Make it uniquely yours.
