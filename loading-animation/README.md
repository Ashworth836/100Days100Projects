# Loading Animation

###### Day 45 of 100

Hey there! Welcome to the Loading Animation project. This is a cool little web animation that you can use to entertain your website visitors while your content loads.

## What's It About?

So, you know when you visit a website, and it takes a moment to load all the text and pictures? It can be a bit boring to stare at a blank screen, right? That's where our loading animation comes in!

## What You'll See

When you open this webpage, you'll see a box with the word "Loading..." in it. But here's the fun part: that word gradually appears, like it's being drawn, and it's mesmerizing to watch!

## How It Works

Under the hood, we're using some cool tricks with HTML and CSS. There's a little animation that makes the word "Loading..." grow from left to right. It gives a sense of progress and keeps your visitors engaged.

## Usage

1. First, you need to include the provided CSS file `main.css` in your project.
2. Then, copy the HTML snippet from this README and paste it into your HTML file where you want the loading animation to appear.
3. That's it! When your webpage loads, your visitors will see this delightful loading animation.

## Customization

Want to change the text or the colors? It's super easy! Just dive into the `main.css` file and tweak the styles to match your website's look and feel.
