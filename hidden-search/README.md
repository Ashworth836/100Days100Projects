# Hidden Search

###### Day 64 of 100

Welcome to the Hidden Search adventure! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è This isn't your typical search bar. It stays discreet until you decide to unleash it. Let's dive into the details.

## How to Use

- **Search Toggle:** Click the search icon, and watch the search bar elegantly appear.
- **Type Away:** Once active, start typing your search query.
- **Hide and Seek:** Click outside the search bar, and it gracefully hides back.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) font from Google Fonts.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the search icon.

## Customization

Feel free to tweak the styles in `main.css` to match your vibe. Change colors, sizes, or anything else‚Äîit's your playground.

## Behind the Scenes

In the `script.js` file, we toggle the "active" class on the search container when the search icon is clicked. This triggers the smooth expansion and contraction of the search bar.
