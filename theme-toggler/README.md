# Theme Toggler

###### Day 49 of 100

Hey there! This is the Theme Toggler project, a small but nifty way to let users switch between light and dark themes on your website.

## What's This All About?

Ever been on a website late at night and felt like the bright screen was burning your eyes? Or maybe you prefer a dark theme because it's easier on your eyes during the day? Well, this project lets users choose! 

With a simple click on the moon or sun icon, your website's theme can switch from light to dark and vice versa. No more squinting at the screen in the dark or blinding yourself during the day.

## How Does It Work?

It's pretty straightforward. You include this small piece of code in your website, and users get a little toggle button that lets them switch between light and dark themes. No complex setups or confusing options.

## Getting Started

To use this Theme Toggler:

1. Copy the HTML code snippet from this README and paste it into your HTML file where you want the theme toggle to appear.

2. Make sure you've got a custom `main.css` file linked to style things according to your website's design.

3. That's it! Your users can now switch themes with a simple click.

## How to Use

1. Open your website.

2. Look for the moon and sun icons in the top right (or wherever you put them).

3. Click on the moon for a dark theme or the sun for a light one.

4. Your eyes are now safe and happy!

## Customization

You can customize the look of the toggle button and icons by editing the `main.css` file. Change the colors, size, or anything else to match your website's style.
