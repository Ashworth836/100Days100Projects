## Overview

This simple web app displays a rotating list of programming affirmations that automatically change every minute. It's a light-hearted way to keep the coding spirit high.

## How It Works

- The app starts with the affirmation "Let's Code."
- Every minute, it dynamically types out a new programming affirmation character by character.
- After displaying the current affirmation, it waits for two seconds before transitioning to the next one.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS (with Google Fonts)
- JavaScript

## Customization

Feel free to modify the list of affirmations in the `script.js` file to include your favorite coding mantras. You can also adjust the timing and styling in the `main.css` file.

Enjoy the positive coding vibes! ðŸ˜Š
