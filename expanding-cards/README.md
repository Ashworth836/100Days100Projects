# Expanding Cards

###### Day 47 of 100

Welcome to the Expanding Cards project! This is a simple and fun way to create interactive cards that expand when you click on them.

## What's It About?

Ever wanted to show information or images in an engaging way on your website? These expanding cards are a cool solution. You have a bunch of cards, and when you click on one, it expands to reveal more content.

## How It Works

It's as easy as clicking on a card! Each card starts in a compact state. When you click on it, it expands smoothly to show more details or a larger image. Click on another card, and the previous one collapses while the new one expands. It's a neat way to display information without overwhelming your users.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the HTML code snippet from this README and paste it into your HTML file where you want these expanding cards to appear.

2. Ensure that you have a custom `main.css` file linked to style the page to your liking.

3. You're good to go! No complicated setup required.

## How to Use

1. Open the webpage, and you'll see a set of cards with beautiful background images.

2. Click on a card, and it will expand to reveal more information or a larger image.

3. Click on another card, and the previous one will collapse while the new one expands. It's a seamless experience.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the look and feel of the cards by editing the `main.css` file. Change the background images or add your own content to each card.
