# Live Visit Count

###### Day 91 of 100

Welcome to this simple webpage that dynamically counts how many times the page has been visited.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/live-visit-count.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`:**
   - Double-click on the `index.html` file.
   - This will open the page in your default web browser.

3. **See the Live Visit Count:**
   - The number next to "This Page Was Viewed" will dynamically update to show how many times the page has been viewed.

## Customization

- **Styles (`main.css`):**
  - You can modify the styles to match your taste. Change colors, font sizes, or anything else to make it visually appealing.

## How It Works

- The visit count is fetched from a server (replace "website" with your actual server endpoint) using JavaScript's `fetch` API.
- The count is then displayed on the page in a large font.

Feel free to integrate this into your website and impress your visitors with a live visit count!

May your page views keep growing! ðŸ“ˆ
