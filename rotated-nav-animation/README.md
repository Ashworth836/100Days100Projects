# Rotated Nav Animation

###### Day 43 of 100

Welcome to the Rotated Nav Animation project! This is a fun little web animation that might remind you of those secret agent movies where they have fancy hidden navigation menus.

## How It Looks

When you open this web page, you'll see a circle with two buttons. One button looks like three horizontal bars (that's the "open" button), and the other looks like a cross (the "close" button). Clicking the "open" button will trigger a cool animation, making the circle rotate and revealing a hidden navigation menu. Clicking "close" will make it all slide back into place.

## What's Inside

Inside this animated circle, you'll find an amazing article by Ash. It's a two-part exploration of dogs, from their fascinating history to their role in modern society. If you're a dog lover or just curious about these incredible animals, you'll enjoy this read.

There are also cute dog pictures sprinkled throughout because, well, who doesn't love adorable dogs? ðŸ¥°

## Features

- Click the "open" button to reveal the hidden navigation menu.
- Click the "close" button to hide the navigation menu and return to the circle.
