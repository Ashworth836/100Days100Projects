Seems like we've hit a roadblockâ€”our 404 page is telling us "Sh*t!" And yes, that's an accurate representation of the situation.

## What Happened?

Well, it appears the page you're seeking has vanished into the digital abyss. We hope it didn't roll into some obscure internet nook where we can't retrieve it. These puns might be "crappy," but we're not giving up!

## Words from the Designer ðŸŽ¨

"Idea and design by [Jane Kathryn Teo](https://dribbble.com/shots/3937555--DailyUI-008-404-Page). Kudos to her for turning a digital dead-end into a creative endeavor!"

## Technical Stuff

- **Fonts:**
  - We're using the charming [Mulish](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish) and [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu) fonts to add a touch of style.

- **Responsive Design:**
  - No matter the device, our 404 page will try its best to make you smile. If you're on a smaller screen, we've tweaked things a bit for a comfy fit.
