# Incrementing Counter

###### Day 93 of 100

Welcome to the Incrementing Counter demo! This simple webpage showcases incrementing counters for social media metrics. Let's see those numbers grow!

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashworth836/incrementing-counter.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`:**
   - Double-click on the `index.html` file.
   - This will open the page in your default web browser.

3. **Watch the Counters Grow:**
   - Three containers will appear, each representing Twitter followers, YouTube subscribers, and Instagram followers.
   - The numbers will start from zero and gradually increase to their respective targets.

## Customization

- **Styles (`main.css`):**
  - You can customize the appearance by changing the font size, colors, or layout in the CSS file.

## How It Works

- The counters increment smoothly from 0 to their specified targets.
- The animation is achieved using JavaScript. The counters start with zero and increase incrementally until they reach their respective targets.

Feel free to integrate this into your projects to display dynamic and engaging metrics.

May your social media presence always be on the rise! ðŸš€
