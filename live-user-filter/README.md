# Live User Filter

###### Day 61 of 100

This is a simple web application that allows users to filter a list of users dynamically based on their names and/or locations. The application fetches user data from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) and displays it in a clean and organized manner.

## Features

- **Live Filtering:** Users can type in the search input, and the user list updates in real-time to show only the relevant results.
- **User Information:** Each user in the list is displayed with their profile picture, name, and location.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Enter the search criteria in the search input to filter the user list.
