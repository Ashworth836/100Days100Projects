# Sparkles

###### Day 84 of 100

Welcome to Sparkles, where you can create your own little universe of particles with just a click!

## How to Sparkle

- **Click anywhere on the screen**: Drop a new particle and watch it dance around.

## About

This is a simple interactive particle system powered by p5.js. Each click creates a particle with a random color, and as they fall, they might split into smaller ones when they reach the bottom.

## Let it Sparkle

Feel free to experiment with the particles. Click, watch them move, and see if you can create a mesmerizing display of colors and motion.

**Enjoy the Sparkles!**
