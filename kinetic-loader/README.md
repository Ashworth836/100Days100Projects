## How It Looks

## Usage

1. Download the provided HTML and CSS files.
2. Link the CSS file in your HTML (`main.css`).
3. Insert the provided HTML code where you want the kinetic loader to appear.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="kinetic"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Customization

Feel free to customize the loader's appearance by tweaking the styles in the `main.css` file.

- Adjust the loader's size by changing the `height` and `width` properties in the `.kinetic` class.
- Modify the color by changing the `border-bottom-color` property in the `.kinetic::before, .kinetic::after` rule.

## How It Works

The kinetic loader is created using CSS animations. It consists of two parts rotating at different angles, creating a dynamic and visually appealing loading effect.
